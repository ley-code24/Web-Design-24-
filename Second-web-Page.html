    <h3> Hello, there I'm Sam</h3>
    <p>
    Giant Panda thats me I weight 90grams. But, I was not just any panda; I am the biggest and the most playful panda in the entire forest. His fluffy black and white fur made him stand out among all the other animals. Every day, Sam would wake up to the sound of birds chirping and the rustling of bamboo leaves. He loved nothing more than to spend his days munching on juicy bamboo shoots and rolling around in the soft grass. He spotted a rabbit in danger. He rescued a trapped rabbit, became the protector of the forest, and made friends with other animals. Sam surprised his friends with a magical evening among fireflies, teaching them that kindness and a touch of magic can make dreams come true. A giant baby panda known for his bravery and kindness became a true warrior.
