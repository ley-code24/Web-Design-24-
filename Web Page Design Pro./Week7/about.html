        <p>
        I am a passionate about learning with a background in having fun.
        My college experience was tough at first, but I'm getting the hang of it.
        I've been observing several clubs on campus, and I am currently attend the Golden Roots Dance Club, which I enjoy very much.
        I'm really excited about my first performance on April 20th, but I'm also very nervous.
        As I continue my college experience, I hope to be a more active participant on and around campus.
