    <P>Scientists have made an incredible discovery in the depths of the ocean - a new species of giant squid that has never
        been seen before. This massive creature, measuring over 30 feet in length, has stunned researchers with its unique
        features and behavior.</P>

    <P>Scientists have made an incredible discovery in the depths of the ocean - a new species of giant squid that has never
        been seen before. This massive creature, measuring over 30 feet in length, has stunned researchers with its unique
        features and behavior.</P>

    <P>Dr. Jane Smith, lead researcher of the expedition, described the moment of discovery as "truly awe-inspiring. We never
        expected to encounter such a magnificent creature in its natural habitat."</P>

    <P>Further studies are underway to learn more about the behavior, diet, and habitat of the Megaloteuthis abyssus, and
        scientists are hopeful that this discovery will shed light on the secrets of the deep ocean. </P>
<h2> Reactions</h2>

  <h1> Where Do Giant Squids Live?</h1>
  <p>Giant squid can be found in oceans around the world at depths of at least 2,950 feet, but their exact geographic range is
    unknown. Giant squid are most often recorded in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and near South Africa and New Zealand,
    according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p>
<p> Some scientists believe that giant squid should be split into multiple different species, including separate species for
    populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Ocean.
    However, a 2013 study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B analyzed 43 giant squid samples collected
    from across their range and found little genetic diversity</p>
